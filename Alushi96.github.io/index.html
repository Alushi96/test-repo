        <p>Hello people reading this page. I currently live in Virginia. I was born in Arlington but am originally from Lebanon.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include rock climbing, skiing, racing, and working on cars. I currently have a mechanic shop and also study mechanical engineering. I decided to take this coding class as i always loved playing with computers and wanted to learn how to code and possibly get a job in coding.</p>
